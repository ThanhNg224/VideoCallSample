ðŸ“± Android Video Call App

This is a custom-built Android application designed for kiosk devices (landscape tablets) to initiate and receive secure video calls using the Stringee SDK. It features:

A clean Material UI optimized for 1280x800 landscape resolution

Real-time video call handling with StringeeCall2

Automatic proximity sensor & audio management during calls

Support for incoming call notifications, permission checks, and UI transitions

Seamless integration with MIUI-based devices including back-press and lock screen handling

The app is structured with modular activities and sensor utilities to support stable performance in embedded environments like kiosks.
